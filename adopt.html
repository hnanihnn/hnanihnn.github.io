    <h1> Adoption Procedures </h1>
    <ol> 1. Visit our shelter during operational hours and see the variety of animals available to choose your cute companion.<br>
     2. Inform our staff on which animal that you would like to take home.<br>
     3. Apply for an adoption by filling in the form given by the staff. <br>
      4. Go through an interview for us to find out about your experience with animals, residence and housing arrangements for the pet. This will determine if you are a suitable owner for it.</ol>
      <p><ol><strong>Important:</strong> 1. Animals cannot be reserved over the telephone or via email. <br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp2. Adoption of an animal cannot be done for anyone who is below the age of 18. <br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp3. Adoption forms cannot be brought back and must be completed on the spot.</ol></p>

      <h3>If You're Considering Adopting A Cat</h3>
      <p>Cats are known to be graceful, athletic, playful, sensitive and affectionate.<br>
<ol>- Cats can be very independent. Make sure everyone knows that the fun begins only after the cat feels safe and its' needs are met. <br>
- Once you're sure everyone is ready for feeding, litter changing and grooming, you can divide up the chores among family members so that everyone will know what to do once it arrives.<br>
- Don't forget to have your feline companion spayed or neutered.</ol></p>

      <h3>If You're Considering Adopting A Dog</h3>
      <p>Loyal and loving, dogs are social animals who thrive on being upstanding members of their families.<br>
      <ol>- If there are little kids in your home, a puppy may not be your best bet. You may want to consider adopting a medium-sized dog over six months of age.<br>
  - Make a schedule of who in the family will help with the care of your new dog including walking, playing, feeding and grooming.<br>
  - As with cats, it is important to have your cute companion spayed or neutered.</ol></p>
